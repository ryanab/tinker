# Tinker

Tinker is an open source fully functional and production ready web app. The exact features will be better documented as development progresses, but the goal is to provide an open-source web-app for developers to learn from.

I have seen a ton of great Youtube series / tutorials to build basic CRUD apps, but usually they are toy apps and I wanted to expand upon some of the great options out these and give almost a reference app someone can use to get started building their own app.

## The app will contain (and again this will be updated as we progress) the following features:

- Basic Authentication and Authorization
- Some less typical Auth/User flows, including Twilio/Sendgrid integration
- Several Entities with basic CRUD Operations
- GraphQL API based on these Entities
- React / Next based frontend
- Typescript
  -Tailwind and [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/)
- Monorepo setup to try and share some types/config across frontend and backend

## If you are curious about the full software development lifecycle, we plan to include:

- CI / CD Setup and documentation
- Deployment Setup and documentation
- Figma Design / Mockups

## We are currently not planning on including the following at this time:

- Stripe/Payment integration

[Ben Awad](https://twitter.com/benawad) - Not sure if there are better tutorials / guides out there then on Benâ€™s Youtube channel for building modern JS apps. Probably one of the biggest inspirations for the project. As of now we are also going to use some of his server package choices and config from [here](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8)
